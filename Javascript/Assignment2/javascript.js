// Functions and Methods assignment
// Read the assignment text CAREFULLY

/*
1.

Write a function that takes in a number as a parameter and returns
"Odd" if the number received is an odd number and "Even" if the number
received is even. Use arrow function syntax.

Console log the function call a few times with both even and odd numbers to
show that it's working.
*/

function oddEven {

}

/*
2.

Write a function that takes in a string as a parameter and returns the string in upper
case with an exclamation mark at the end. Use the non-arrow function syntax (function keyword).

Example: console.log(yourFunction("this is cool")) should console log THIS IS COOL!
Console log the function a few times to show that it's working.
*/

/*
3.

Write a function that takes in 2 parameters:

 - A name (string)
 - An hour of the day (number)

The function should return:
"Good night (name received)" if the hour received is 0-6
"Good morning (name received)" if the hour received is 6-12
"Good day (name received)" if the hour received is 12-18
"Good evening (name received)" if the hour received is 18-24
"Invalid time" if the hour received is greater than 24

Use whichever function syntax you want.

Example console.log(yourFunction("Gunnar", 19)) should console log Good evening Gunnar
Console log the function a few times to show that it's working.

let name = "Kim"

/*
4.

Use string methods on the text variable to do the following:

*/
const text = "  Javascript is hard   ";

EXTRA CHALLENGE

This is not mandatory, only for those who want an extra challenge.

Make a function called coolMaker that takes in 1 parameter.

If the parameter received is a string: 
Return the string with "😎" added to the beginning and end

If the parameter received is a number:
Double it, convert it to a string and return it with "😎" added to the beginning and end.

If the parameter received is a boolean:
If the parameter received is true, return "😎Yeah😎". If the parameter received is false, return "😎Chill😎"

If the parameter received is any other datatype:
Return "😎Primitive values only😎"

Use arrow function syntax.

Console log the function call with a few different datatypes to show that it's working
