!READ THE ASSIGNMENT TEXT CAREFULLY!
------------------------------------

Use a normal for loop to loop over the people array and do the following:

- Make a new key on each person object in the array called "city" and set the value to a random city 
	from the cities array.

- Make a new key on each person object called "title" and set it to "Mr." for males and "Ms." for females.
	
- Increment the age by 1

- Add "coding" to the hobby array on each object.

PS: Use only 1 loop to do the above steps.

console.log(people) after your loop to check that your changes are correct.

Feel free to ask me or Joe if you're stuck, and remember the deadline is this friday!
